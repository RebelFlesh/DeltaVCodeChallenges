#KATA INSTRUCTIONS
This kata asked that we take an array of 3 numbers and give the index of the middle integer, the one that isn't the larger or the smaller.

#Our Solution
The way my partner and I went about it was to put the array in a for loop and check if each integer is the largest in the array or the smallest. If it was neither then it was the one we were looking for.
