##Kata instructions
Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!

##Our solutions
Here we ran this into a for loop that made two strings that made each letter capitol if even and lowercase if odd, the second string was the reverse.
